# EncryptedTrafficAnalysis-GAN-

NIS Course project:
Generative AI for Encrypted Traffic Analysis

Summary:
This project evaluates the quality of synthetic email traffic data generated using CTGAN by comparing it to real data through statistical tests (KL divergence, JS distance, KS test, IDS, PCA) and model performance (XGBoost, MLP, Gradient Boosting). Classification models trained on synthetic data are benchmarked against real-data models using ROC AUC and other metrics. The analysis confirms how closely the synthetic data approximates real data in both distribution similarity and predictive performance. accuracy: 92.24%
